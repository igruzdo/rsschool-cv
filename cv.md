    Other information:
    I love the IT. I realized this when I started writing complex formulas in Excel, creating 
    interactive tables and reports, where the whole picture changes with one click. I am eager to learn web 
    development! It is a great pleasure to see how beautifully organized code turns into a living organism in front of the user.
